# Thermal-Motion
Using a motion tracker, the motions of microscopic beads in water are recorded. The data are processed using Python to check whether the distribution of the displacement is Gaussian, as the theory suggests. Finally, using curve fit, the probability distribution function of the beads is found, and used to estimate Avogadroâ€™s number.
